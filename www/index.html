            Some notes:
                * gap: is required only on iOS (when using UIWebView) and
                  is needed for JS->native communication
                * https://ssl.gstatic.com is required only on Android and
                  is needed for TalkBack to function properly
                * Disables use of inline scripts in order to mitigate risk
                  of XSS vulnerabilities. To change this:
                    * Enable inline JS: add 'unsafe-inline' to default-src
